FullscreenLayoutPageTransitions-Angular.js
==========================================

A fork of [@codrops](https://github.com/codrops)' awesome full-screen layout with page transitions example converted to Angular.js

This responsive layout is based on an initial grid of four boxes. Once a box is clicked, it gets resized to fullscreen and the other boxes scale down and fade out.

To run the example, clone the repo and run 'gulp build' to convert Sass and compile the build directory.
